Modular Design Implementation
We'll structure the application into several modules or classes:

ImageProcessor: For preprocessing images.
FeatureExtractor: To extract features from characters for SVM training and prediction.
CharacterSegmenter: For improved character segmentation using morphological operations.
SVMClassifier: Wrapper around the SVM functionality, including training and prediction.
PlateRecognizer: Main class to orchestrate the detection and recognition process.
